			<h2>Second iteration - <em>Free as in free beer ?</em></h2>
			<img src="images/coins.jpeg" width="100" height = "100" style="float: right;"/>
			
			<p>The coffee machine is not free anymore! One tea is 0,4 euro, a coffee is 0,6 euro, a chocolate is 0,5 euro.</p>
			<p>The drink maker will <strong>now</strong> only make drink if enough money is given for a drink</p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The drink maker should make the drinks only if the correct amount of money is given for a drink</li>
				<li>If not enough money is provided, we want to send a message to the drink maker. The message should contains at least the amount of money missing.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Important</h3>
			<p>Do not worry about notifyng the customer directly as the drink maker forward any message received onto the coffee machine interface for the customer to see.</p>
			<p>If too much money is given, the drink maker will make the drink and the machine will handle the return of the correct change. So do not worry about that.</p>
			<p>Remember that the drink maker will forward any messages received onto the coffee machine interface for the customer to see.</p>
