			<h2>Fifth iteration - <em>Running out</em></h2>
			<p>The users of the coffee machine are complaining that there is often shortages of water and/or milk. It takes weeks before
			the machine is refilled.</p>
			<p>Your product owner wants to you to take advantage of the machine capabilities to inform the user that there is a shortage 
			and to send a email notification to the company so that they can come and refill the machine.</p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>When I order a drink and it can be delivered because of a shortage, I want to see a message to the coffee machine 
				console that indicates me the shortage and 
				that a notification has been sent</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Implementation details</h2>
			<p>You can take advantages of the 2 services implemented by the coffee machine:</p>
			<pre>public interface EmailNotifier {
	void notifyMissingDrink(String drink)
}</pre>
	<pre>public interface BeverageQuantityChecker {
	boolean isEmpty(String drink)
}</pre>
		<p>Add those two services to your project and use mocking to finish your story.</p>
