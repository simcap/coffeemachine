			<h2>Fourth iteration - <em>Making money</em></h2>
			<img src="images/graph.jpeg" width="100" height = "87" style="float: right;"/>
			<p>The machine is becoming popular in the office. The management is eager to have daily reports of what is sold and when.</p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to be able to print a report anytime that contains: how many of each drink was sold and the total amount of money earned so far.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Implementation details</h2>
			<p>For the reporting, you can have a repository of data with a simple data structure in memory. A simple reporting can be done by printing to the console. Of course all of that should be tested before it is written, but you know that already, don't you ? ;)</p>
